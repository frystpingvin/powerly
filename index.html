In worst cases, forgetting to turn off kitchen appliances can lead to a fire.</p> <p>In my case, this is the problem: I’m a huge fan of porridge. There is few breakfast meals that keeps me full all the way to lunch, but porridge is one of them. Unfortunately I have a bit of a bad reputation about forgetting the oven on, especially in the morning.</p> <p>I usually double check that I turned the oven off, but if I forget that after leaving I either have to go back to my apartment and check that the oven is off or just have the nagging feeling in the back of my head that there is a slight chance I’m currently burning down the whole neighborhood.</p> </div> <div class=text__column> <h3>The solution</h3> <p>Using existing technologies such as an Arduino we can create a device which both can measure power consumption and work as a digital power switch.</p> <p>This device will be plugged in the wall and an associated app communicates via internet with the device. With the app one can turn control the power supply, and therefore turn off the connected appliance, while outside of the home.</p> <p>By tracking the users location we can give the user a notification about an appliance consuming a lot of power (indicating that is on) and ask them if they want to turn it off. In my case, that means no more worrying about burning down the neighborhood.</p> </div> </div> </article> <section class=container> <div class=feature> <div class=feature__header> <h1>This is how it works</h1> </div> <div class=feature__secondary-content> <img class=feature__image src="images/setup.png" alt="Setup view"> </div> <div class=feature__primary-content> <h3>Easy to set up</h3> <ol> <li>Plug in your Powerly device to the wall socket.</li> <li>Plug in the power cable for the appliance you want to connect into the Powerly device.</li> <li>Open upp the app and give your new Powerly device a name.</li> </ol> </div> </div> <div class=feature> <div class=feature__secondary-content> <img class=feature__image src="images/device-view.png" alt="Device view"> </div> <div class=feature__primary-content> <h3>Control your device or set up a timer</h3> <p>You can manually turn on and off the power to your device from anywhere (as long as you have an internet connection). If you want to, you can even enable a timer function so the device is turned on during the time and days you specify.</p> <p> With the timer function we can solve other daily problems such as: <ul> <li> An ”automatic” coffee maker. Fill your coffee maker with water and coffee in the evening, setup a timer so the power switch only is enabled between 07:30 and 08:30 during weekdays. Wake up to freshly brewed coffee and you be more ready than ever to conquer the day! </li> <li> Do you want to regulate TV time? Connect your TV to the power switch and only enable power do it during a specified period each day. </li> </ul> </p> </div> </div> <div class=feature> <div class=feature__secondary-content> <img class=feature__image src="images/notification.png" alt="Powerly notification"> </div> <div class=feature__primary-content> <h3>Get notified if you forgot something on</h3> <p>Never worry about forgetting the oven on again! The app gives you a notification if the power consumption indicates that the device is turned on when you leave home. If you forgot it, you can just turn the device off from the app!</p> </div> </div> </section> <footer class=site-footer> <div class=container> <div class=site-footer__content> <h3>Test the <span class=brand-color>Powerly</span> prototype here</h3> <iframe width=442 height=935 src="//invis.io/7FGMYHARJHB" frameborder=0 allowfullscreen></iframe> <hr> <p> Powerly is a concept app used as a submission to the Hyper Island 2018 Application Task.
